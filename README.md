# Vulkantastic

My playground for learning different aspects of Vulkan and engine development.

## Requirements:

* Python 3.7
* Visual Studio 2019

Python is used for scripts that are run before compilation.
These scripts are for preprocessing data like vertex definitions, meshes and images.

## Some of the current features:

* Vulkan abstraction layer
* Manager for GPU's memory
* Shader reflection system
* Arrays of textures
* Vertex definition reflection
* Meshes and images preprocessing
